        This is my attempt to put some ideas and thoughts into writing. The
        purpose of this is just to 1). Practise my programming by building this
        website and 2). I hope to get things clearer by putting thoughts into
        words. And if you ever find this site and read some posts, hope you get
        something useful from it. cheers!
